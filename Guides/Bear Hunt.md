# General Tips
- There are 2 different trap times that are scheduled via R4/R5. 
  - You can only participate in 1 trap so choose the one that fits your schedule best. 
- Lethality is the most important stat for Bear Hunt
- The bear itself doesn’t inflict damage; the event is entirely focused on maximizing how much damage players can deal to it.
- To maximize damage, only specific heroes should be chosen when joining a rally—most importantly the Joiner Hero. 
  - This is the hero placed in the first slot of each squad. A rally can gain up to four additional skills from joiners, with each member contributing one. 
  - If more than four joiners are present, only the heroes with the highest level expedition skills will be counted.
    - For this reason, it’s crucial to choose the right heroes when joining a rally and avoid unintentionally replacing a lethality or attack‑boosting skill with another ability, such as boosting defense
