### Levels

## General Rules
- Resources (RSS) Points are weighted based on ease of gathering and are not 1 to 1. 
  - 1 Unit of Bread AND Wood are worth 1 point  
  - 1 unit of Stone is worth 5 points
  - 1 unit of Iron is worth 20 points
## Strategies
- Expectation here is simply to send your heroes out and gather resources. 
- Prioritize heroes based on what resource is being gathered
-- Olive = Bread
-- Edwin = Stone
-- Seth = Iron
-- Forrest = Wood
- You can pregame the event by sending out and gathering resources prior to the event starting and ensuring your gathers are timed to return after the event has started and the task has been accepted. This does require the task appearing, so recommendation is to allow for at least 1 or 2 hours of time refreshing and hunting for the resource gathering task. 
## Prior to Task Selection
- Ensure that you understand how many resource nodes you need to hit in order to hit your selected requirement.
